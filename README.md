# Metacrafters-Project-1-
This project is a simple JavaScript implementation for minting, listing, and managing NFTs. The code provides functions to create NFTs with metadata and display them.

First we have a variable named var mynfts which stores  the metadata of nfts

#First Function
mintNFT(Tagline, eyecolor, Clothestype, bling, TokenId)
This function creates a new NFT with specified attributes and adds it to the mynfts array.

Parameters:

Tagline: The name or tagline of the NFT.
eyecolor: The eye color attribute of the NFT.
Clothestype: The type of clothes the NFT is wearing.
bling: Any additional accessories or bling the NFT has.
TokenId: A unique identifier for the NFT.

#Second function
listNFTs()
This function lists all the minted NFTs and their attributes in the console.

#Third function 
getTotalSupply()
This function prints the total number of NFTs minted to the console.

This simple project demonstrates basic operations for minting and managing NFTs using JavaScript
